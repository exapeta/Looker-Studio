GOOGLE LOOKER STUDIO

In this screenshot, I've put together a dashboard for current web traffic. It tracks users and bounce rate, and shows the top visited pages. It also shows the sources & mediums that are users our visiting the site from. This data is pulled from Google Analytics 4, as well as Google Ads. 

For future iterations of this dashboard, I would focus on removing uncessary charts or metrics, to help make the dahsboard more concise. I would add clearer labels to the data as well, to make it easier for users to gain insights without having to scour through the dashboard for ages. Although there is a level of interactivity with this dashboard, I would also focus on making it user friendly, so any interactive elements are clearly displayed as such.
